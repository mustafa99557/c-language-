## 🧐 About

This is my first repository in C programming, containing various sample programs that explore algorithms, data structures, and utility tasks.  
Use these examples to learn, experiment, or build upon.

## 🔍 Features & Examples

Some of the C programs included here:

- `bubblesort.c` — Bubble sort implementation  
- `selectionsort.c` — Selection sort  
- `insertionsort.c` — Insertion sort  
- `Doublelinkedlist.c` — Doubly linked list operations  
- `CQue.c`, `modifiesCqueue.c` — Circular queue implementation  
- `postfix.c`, `modified postfix.c` — Postfix expression evaluation  
- `balancedstack.c` — Balanced parenthesis / stack examples  
- `concatstrings.c` — String concatenation  
- `matrixadd.c`, `modifiedMatrixaddition.c` — Matrix addition  
- `fibonacci.c` — Fibonacci sequence  
- `modifiedMatrixaddition.c`, `modified postfix.c` etc.  

And more. Each file demonstrates a specific concept or algorithm in C.

## 🛠 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g. `gcc`)  
- A terminal or command-line environment  
- Basic knowledge of C (pointers, arrays, functions)

### How to Compile & Run

1. Open terminal and navigate to the folder containing the C file, e.g.:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/repo

2. Compile a C program using `gcc` (or your favorite compiler). Example:

   ```bash
   gcc bubblesort.c -o bubblesort
   ```

3. Run the compiled executable:

   ```bash
   ./bubblesort
   ```

   Some programs may accept user input (e.g. size, values) — follow the prompts.
